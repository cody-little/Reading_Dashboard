# Reading_Dashboard

### Introduction

This is a dashboard I created in my spare time to keep track of all the books that I read. It inlcudes the book title, authors, page count, and the year in which I read them.

### Functionality 

The app uses R shiny to build and deploy itself onto rsconnect.io. It draws its data from an excel file. You can filter by year or use the table of all the books to filter by category and search. I use the app on my phone by making a url shortcut to it. To update the app I just update the excel file, run the script in Rstudio, and then hit re-publish.
